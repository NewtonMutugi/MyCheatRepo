To change directory permissions in Linux, use the following:
    $chmod +rwx filename to add permissions.
    $chmod -rwx directoryname to remove permissions.
    $chmod +x filename to allow executable permissions.
    $chmod -wx filename to take out write and executable permissions.
Note that “r” is for read, “w” is for write, and “x” is for execute.

The command for changing directory permissions for group owners is similar, but add a “g” for group or “o” for users:

    $chmod g+w filename
    $chmod g-wx filename
    $chmod o+w filename
    $chmod o-rwx foldername
example of how to change directory permissions in Linux for group owners and others

To change directory permissions for everyone, use “u” for users, “g” for group, “o” for others, and “ugo” or “a” (for all).

    $chmod ugo+rwx foldername to give read, write, and execute to everyone.
    $chmod a=r foldername to give only read permission for everyone.


// How to Change Permissions in Numeric Code in Linux
0 = No Permission
1 = Execute
2 = Write
4 = Read

Permission numbers are:

0 = ---
1 = --x
2 = -w-
3 = -wx
4 = r-
5 = r-x
6 = rw-
7 = rwx

For example:
    $chmod 777 foldername will give read, write, and execute permissions for everyone.
    $chmod 700 foldername will give read, write, and execute permissions for the user only.
    $chmod 327 foldername will give write and execute (3) permission for the user, w (2) for the group, and read, write, and execute for the users.
